# Feedback

## Code Quality: Excelling
Code is clean, and used sensible variables
* Leave unused code out

## Technical requirements: Excelling
Awesome! You got most of the js concepts down well for this project. I recommend taking a look at jQuery 

## Creativity and Interface: Excelling
In the age of mobile apps I would've liked to see something a slight change when it comes to making it mobile friendly
* the start and reset buttons can stack to make the area where the tap might happen bigger and not make the reset button so close to the playing board

## Presentation: Excelling
Good work with the md file, but would also be good to see your references in your md

## Additional Feedback
* Design feedback: vamp up the simon theme!
if you had an array of arrays you can set the board dynamically 
I created these arrays if you were interested. (The links are the pallettes themselves!)

coolors.co creates these pallettes for you

```javascript
let colors = [
    ["#08874D", "#07A0C3", "#F0C808" "#DD1C1A"], 
    ["#1B9AAA", "#07ED8D", "#EF476F" "#FFC43D"], 
]
```
